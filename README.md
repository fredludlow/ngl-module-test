## What?

This is a quick demo of using NGL (https://github.com/nglviewer/ngl) as a node module, building a simple page
using rollup.

It provides a simple page with a single embedded view of a protein.

## What to do?

```bash
# Clone it
git clone https://github.com/fredludlow/ngl-module-test

# Install
npm install 

# Build
npm run build

# Serve the files, e.g. with python
python -m http.server 8080
```

Click here: (http://localhost:8080/index.html) - or wherever else you're hosting it

## What now?

Anything you want - this is just some very minimal boilerplate!
